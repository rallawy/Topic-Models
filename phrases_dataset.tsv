The wolf didn't know how to read	0
As with any trilogy, this book was more about the getting from point A (book 1) to point B (book 3, presumably, where there is resolution), full of nice bits of action and the building up of tension for the third book.	1

So, cute !! Sophie doesn't want to eat the squash bought at the market but to keep it as her friend and companion - all is well until little squash starts getting some brown spots - sweet and fun!!	1
Too much information, especially when revealed in a story utilizing the third person omniscience of the all knowing, all seeing, all explaining author, lends a detachment to the reader that makes it difficult to invest fully in the characters	-1
Not so much that it was supposedly a cliffhanger (because to me, it honestly wasn't) but just the ending itself	-1
I love the way she makes you feel you truly are down 'south' .	1

But this lovely book, and my constant search for new reading material for my children, sparked my curiosity	1
In particularly, I kind of enjoyed the fact that the Devil can be a superhero in the right light.	1
Names, species, factions, how will you keep it all straight? While Barnes' world is fully realized, it is a departure from the familiar	1

As I read the first five or so pages, I thought to myself, "Lois Duncan isn't really a great writer," but then as I got about five more pages in I realized that, no, Duncan isn't a great writer, but she can tell one hell of a story	1
They're happy, I can tell	1
As it's a collection, I can't paint all authors included with the same brush	0
So why the struggle up to three stars? This book failed for me on purely technical merits	-1
While slow to start (beginnings, although not exposition full, are a little awkward/slow to build), Sanderson provides a stunningly well thought out magic system (something he's known for and for good reason), as well as high paced, well written fantasy action	1
Not the same impact it created on me on the first book.	-1
If anything this book is a quick, enjoyable read that will keep you on the edge of your seat.	1
The reason this is three stars instead of four is that I listened to the audiobook instead of reading the hard copy	0

Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book	1
While I think Hill played the devilish references a bit much (from the Evil Knieval trail to the number of times he throws 666 out there), the book was still a fun read and well worth the price of admission	1

This book is all about female empowerment while also tackling many subjects such as racism, stereotyping, and sexuality	0
All of the ingredients for a great read!	1
It's a fun, fantastical "mystery" full of oddball characters: a bearded lady, a time-traveling ugly man who may or may not have founded London, two assassins dressed like overgrown prep-school drop-outs, a human fly, and, of course, the titular side kick, the Somnambulist	1
I think this could make a good read aloud grade 4-6	1
Markus Zusak made a post about how he enjoyed this book	1
Thank you to both parties for the opportunity to read this book in advance - it's been hard holding this review until closer to publication :)	1

I would definitely like to read more about the characters in this story	1
Our understanding of the world is so incomplete we are left questioning what is happening for part of the book	0
I did, however, feel that the conclusion to The Corpse with the Garnet Face was rather confusing, even as Cait laid out all their findings, I still felt lost	-1
This book is an excellent example of how you can do a really good third person mystery	1
Well I liked it	1
The wolf looked anywhere except at the pages of words	0
Of course, the truly brave writer - and this is why epic fantasy is known for its lengthy tomes, I think - will layer their explanations and insights about their fantasy world through the telling of the novel, so that while you may start not knowing who Bahl is or what a white-eyes is, by the end of the story you'll catch yourself swearing in Bahl's name and cursing the blight that is a white-eye born man	0
It feels good too	1
This story takes place after Skin Game (book 15)	0
It's dark, and every page drips with what's not being said, and the tension of knowing that someone (probably everyone) is lying is thick, thick, thick	1
Really aggravated and disappointed but happy that I finally finished reading and got it over with.	-1

I feel like there was a lot left unexplained	-1
But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story	0

I think that in this setting and in this story a sociopath makes a really interesting character (and one I'd have liked explored just a bit further)	0

Every time I felt I had a grasp, we were introduced to a new character that made me question whether we were speaking the same language	-1
His descriptions and use of novelistic elements to tell this story work beautifully and bring out more dimensions than another writer would have gotten to.	1
This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers	0
I'm looking forward to the rest.	1

Some sass and strength and a lot of humanity in a non-human	1
And when they meet, it is pure magic	1
Ohlsson, though, seems to have a fascination with unfaithful husbands; they're all over the place, and each is dealt with in a different way, which is interesting if done as a character study, but there's not enough detail in each relationship, so they're just sort of	-1
